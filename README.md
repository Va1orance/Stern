# Stern
Stern is a modern keyboard layout optimized for split keyboards. It utilizes one thumb alpha.

```
  v d l p q  / g o u ,
  s t h n b  y c a e i
  x k m f z  j w ' ; .
        r                   

MT-QUOTES:
  Alt: 33.95%
  Rol: 42.55%   (In/Out: 20.95% | 21.60%)
  One:  2.98%   (In/Out:  0.37% |  2.60%)
  Rtl: 45.53%   (In/Out: 21.33% | 24.20%)
  Red:  2.33%   (Bad:     0.24%)

  SFB: 0.35%
  SFS: 4.29%    (Red/Alt: 0.74% | 3.55%)

  LH/RH: 49.92% | 50.08%
```

It is designed to optimize SFBs, Redirects, Alternation and One hands. 
Note*: In recent studies, redirects may not have as much of an effect as initially thought.

## Design Process
The first priority of this layout was to maintain the sth homerow. This is to maintain the STR onehand, and TH_ inward roll. I already knew that I wanted to use R as the thumb key. AEI homerow was understood as ideal. 

Next was deciding what to place on the index fingers. I wanted to use a double stack layout, so C was placed on the right index for the high movement required. Thus, N was left for the left key.

For column specific optimizations, I wanted to have good key positions with appropriate usage. This is why I used a VS_ column instead of using FS_ column. Using FS_ may yield slightly better stats. DTK was a really interesting column that I stole directly from SNTHR by nechro. It is an almost perfect fit for ring, having a high high row usage, and a low-ish low row usage. The most questionable key position on this layout is the choice of an LHM column. This requires a relatively high amount of middle finger curl that most are likely not used to coming from row optimized layouts. Because this layout was designed for column staggared and Dactyl/Manuform, this is generally not a big problem (and I find it more comfortable than middle column usage). Generally, if you don't like curls and are okay with more middle column usage, I would recommend using using a layout like Dusk --- Add link™️

Everything else is generally pretty standard for a modern layout. YOU can be optimized by swapping GYW around, placing the YOU in a row. I decided against this as I did not like having G in the middle column.
